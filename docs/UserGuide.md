Format:

```

```

This command deletes the internship application at index 2 from the list.

---

### Updating an application: `update`

Use this command to update any field (company, role, deadline, pay, status) of an internship application.  


<div style="background-color: #333446; color: #EAEFEF; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; border-left: 5px solid #7F8CAA;">
<h4><strong>Valid <code>STATUS</code> values</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><code>Pending</code> - You’re considering the internship but haven’t applied yet.</li>
<li><code>Interested</code> - You’ve found the internship and might apply.</li>
<li><code>Applied</code> - You’ve submitted your application.</li>
<li><code>Interviewing</code> - You’re currently in the interview process.</li>
<li><code>Offer</code> - You’ve received an internship offer.</li>
<li><code>Accepted</code> - You’ve accepted the offer.</li>
<li><code>Rejected</code> - The application was unsuccessful or withdrawn.</li>
</ul>
</div>

Format:

```
update INDEX field1/VALUE1 field2/VALUE2 ...
```

Example:

```
update 1 status/Accepted
update 2 company/Microsoft status/Interviewing
```

The 1st command updates the status of the internship application at index 1 to "Accepted".

The 2nd command updates the company of the internship application at index 2 to "Microsoft" and its status to "Interviewing".

<div style="background-color: #331c16; color: #c3b091; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; border-left: 5px solid #966919;">
<h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>All field values must adhere to the constraints specified in the <code>add</code> feature.</li>
<li>If duplicate field values are given, only the last field will be used.
<br>
Example: <code>update 1 company/ABC company/XYZ</code> will update the company of the internship application at index 1 to "XYZ".</li>
</ul>
</div>

---

### Listing all applications: `list`

Use this command to view all internship applications.
You can optionally sort them by deadline in ascending or descending order.

Format:

```
list
list sort/ORDER
```

Example:

```
list
list sort/asc
list sort/desc
```

- `list` → shows all applications in the order they were added
- `list sort/asc` → sorts applications by deadline ascending
- `list sort/desc` → sorts applications by deadline descending

<div style="background-color: #331c16; color: #c3b091; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; border-left: 5px solid #966919;">
<h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>If two applications have the same deadline, they are further sorted by the order they were added.</li>
<li>The <code>sort/ORDER</code> parameter is optional. If omitted, the default listing order is by addition time.</li>
<li>When sorting is applied, the selected order will persist for subsequent listings.</li>
</ul>
</div>

---

### Finding by keyword: `find`

Search for internship applications by keyword. The search is case-insensitive.

Format:

```
find KEYWORD
```

Example:

```
find Software Engineer
```

This command lists all internship applications that contain the keyword "Software Engineer" in either its company or
role details.

---

### Setting/Changing username: `username`

Use this command to set or change the username for the Internity application.

and a breakdown of internships by status.

Format:

```
dashboard
```

<div style="background-color: #331c16; color: #c3b091; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; border-left: 5px solid #966919;">

## FAQ

* **Q: How do I transfer my data to another computer?**
<br> A: Make a copy of the `data/` folder of the home directory that runs `Internity.jar` to the new computer. Ensure that
  the folder structure remains intact.


* **Q: I have encountered an invalid command error. What do I do?** 
  <br> A: Refer to the [Features](#features) section for details on using a command.


* **Q: Does Internity work without Internet?**
  <br> A: Yes, Internity does not require an active internet connection, allowing you to manage your internships
  seamlessly!


* **Q: My application unexpectedly closed. Will my previous entries be saved?**
  <br> A: Yes, Internity automatically saves your data after each command, ensuring that your entries are preserved even in the event of an unexpected closure.


* **Q: How can I reset my data to start fresh?**
  <br> A: Close the app and delete or rename the `data/internships.txt` file. On next start, the app will create a new empty data file. Be careful: this deletes all saved internships.


* **Q: I see warnings about corrupted lines being deleted when I start Internity — what happened?**
  <br> A: On startup, Internity scans the save file (`data/internships.txt`) for malformed or corrupted lines. If any problematic lines are found, the program automatically detects and removes those lines to keep the data consistent and prints a warning for each deleted line. These warnings appear before the welcome message.
  <br>*Important*: the deletions are staged in memory and are NOT written back to the save file immediately. The cleaned data is only persisted to disk when the program executes a command. If you force-quit the program (for example, pressing Ctrl+C) before typing any command, the program exits without saving and the original save file will remain unchanged.
