' --- Scenario 1: Adding a new internship ---
' User types an `add` command; Logic parses and hands off a semantic request to Model
' Model validates high-level constraints then delegates to the list component
Logic -> InternshipList: add(...)
activate InternshipList
' InternshipList constructs a new Internship object (calls constructor)
create Internship
InternshipList -> Internship: new Internship(...)
activate Internship
' Internship object parses and stores a Date and Status internally
create Date
Internship -> Date: parse(deadline) : Date
activate Date
Date --> Internship: (created)
deactivate Date

Internship -> Internship : set Status to Pending
' Construction returns the Internship instance to InternshipList
Internship --> InternshipList: (created)
deactivate Internship

' InternshipList appends to internal collection

InternshipList -> InternshipList: add(Internship)
activate InternshipList

' After mutation, Model requests Storage to persist the updated list
InternshipList --> InternshipList
deactivate InternshipList

Logic <-- InternshipList
deactivate InternshipList
