### Architecture

### UI Component

### Logic Component

#### Overview
The Logic component is responsible for:
- Parsing user input commands.
- Creating the appropriate `Command` object.
- Executing that command to modify the Model or interact with the UI.

#### How it Works
1. User input (e.g. `add company/Google role/SWE deadline/10-10-2025 pay/1000`) is received by CommandParser.
2. The `CommandParser`:
   - Validates that the input is not empty or malformed.
   - Splits the input into a command keyword and arguments.
   - Passes them into the `CommandFactory`.
3. The `CommandFactory`:
   - Matches the keyword to a corresponding `Command` subclass (e.g. `AddCommand`).
   - Uses the `ArgumentParser` to interpret argument strings.
   - Returns a fully constructed `Command` object.
4. The `Command` object executes its logic (e.g. adds a new internship to `InternshipList`).
5. The result of the execution is printed ot the console via the `Ui`.

#### Sequence Diagram
Below is a simplified interaction for the `delete 1` command:
